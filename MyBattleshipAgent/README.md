# MyBattleshipAgent #

I wrote a library that the Battleship Program imports and uses. The library creates a Battleship Agent that is able to play the game. It plays the game by implementing these six methods:

1) Initialize
2) GetNickname
3) SetOpponent
4) PositionFleet
5) LaunchAttack
6) DamageReport
