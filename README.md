# Battleship-Game #

Created a bot that autonomously plays a virtual version of the Battleship Board Game. The bot  was created as part of a "plugin" architecture by implementing an abstract class. My bot maintains its own internal representation of the game with a state machine and uses this the state to choose an optimal move. My bot was able to defeat the majority of competitors and fared well against the instructor's agent.
